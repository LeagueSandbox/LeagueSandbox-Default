Lore1 = To some, Nasus is a demigod who walks among the ruins of an ancient civilization; to others, he is nothing more than a myth. Legend speaks of his dominion over death and time. Millennia ago, he stood at the apex of Shuriman society as curator and guardian. He now roams the arid wastes, seeking to release his brother Renekton from the grip of madness.

Tips1 = <ul><li>Paying attention to last hitting with Siphoning Strike will have a large impact at the end of a game.<li>If you're solo, Spirit Fire is a great way to farm a lane. It can be bad if you're in a lane with 2 and you push too far. Find the right balance between Siphoning Strike last hits and AoE farming.<li>If you have low defenses, people will focus you down even during your ultimate. Try buying some survivability items even in your DPS builds.</ul>
Tips2 = <ul><li>While transformed by his ultimate, Nasus is stronger than most champions in the League. Engage him only if you have a clear advantage.<li>Max rank Wither is a very effective counter to Attack Damage characters, so try to avoid getting caught alone by it.<li>Nasus is prone to being kited. Try not to engage him at full Health.</ul>
