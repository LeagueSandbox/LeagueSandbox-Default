Lore1 = A terrifying and tragic figure, Yorick is a ghoulish being that exists on the edge of mortality. Some say he was the last of his family line, dying without an heir to continue its legacy, and that he is cursed to continue to his family's duty even after death. Wielding the twisted shovel he bore in life, he continues his macabre work, endlessly digging and filling graves upon the haunted Shadow Isles.
Lore2 = As time passed, she became the cause of much trouble in Jugo. People became afraid of Annie because of the sudden fires that erupted when the little girl was in a bad mood. Several years later, she threw a temper tantrum over a dropped teddy bear, and completely incinerated her parents and her home. She has since drifted aimlessly from town to town, sometimes becoming angry over a trivial matter at which point great fire storms erupt leaving only a crying orphan girl in their wake. When the darkness inside of her felt the first call of Chaos, it discovered befitting and truly sinister use for the Dark Child.

Tips2 = <ul><li>You can use Summoner Spell Smite on Yorick's minions to immediately negate their effects.<li>When Yorick uses his ultimate on an ally, it may be easier to kill the Revenant before focusing back on the target who would otherwise revive.<li>The amount of health restored by Omen of Famine is based on the actual damage dealt, so Magic Resistance will lower its effectiveness.</ul>
