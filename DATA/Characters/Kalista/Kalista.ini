Lore1 = Kalista is an eternal spirit of retribution, who possesses a cold-burning hatred for all betrayers, deceivers, and traitors. In life, she was a legendary warrior, but while trying to avert tragedy she was betrayed and slain by those she trusted most. Now, she is an undying entity that can be invoked to exact vengeance, but only at great cost: the supplicant’s soul becomes forfeit, bound to her for eternity.

Tips1 = <ul><li>Rend is a valuable last hitting aid, since its cooldown resets if it kills a target. <li>Entering a move order once to trigger Martial Poise will not clear Kalista's basic attack target. Due to her passive, Kalista's Movement Speed is effectively increased by Attack Speed.</ul>
Tips2 = <ul><li>Kalista's mobility is dependent upon attacking. This means it is low when she is outside of her attack range and that Attack Speed slows reduce the amount of distance she can cover in an engagement.<li>Kalista cannot cancel her basic attack wind up. While she is very mobile, this offers a window to land spells on her if you anticipate when she will begin attacking.</ul>
