Tips1 = <ul><li>Sivir's Boomerang Blade returns to her after reaching the max range, so you can shift position to hit enemies who would otherwise have evaded it.<li>Ricochet resets Sivir's basic attack timer on activation, so activating this immediately after landing a normal basic attack will maximize damage output.<li>Try saving Spell Shield for enemy abilities that can disable you such as stuns and roots.</ul>
Tips2 = <ul><li>Boomerang Blade costs a lot of mana to cast, so dodging it sets Sivir back. If it hits you on the way out, avoid its path on the way back.<li>Sivir is a powerful pushing champion, so leaving her unattended in a lane for too long will often result in your turrets being destroyed.<li>When laning against Sivir, it is possible to throw off the timing of her Spell Shield by faking an advance, then backing off.</ul>
